# Abstract

When a short position is margin called, some of its collateral will be sold
and some or all of its debt will be covered accordingly.

However, usually more collateral will be sold, in comparison to the minimum
amount required to be sold to maintain the maintenance collateral ratio (MCR)
requirement.

This BSIP proposes a protocol change to let shortes (borrowers) have control
over selling how much collateral when being margin called.

# Motivation

As discussed in [this forum
post](https://bitsharestalk.org/index.php?topic=25924.0), current process gives
manipulators big chance to short BTS and make money and increase the risk of
black swan, thus hurts the BTS ecosystem. Many participants in the discussion
agree that usually it's not really required to cover all debt (thus selling more
collateral) when being margin called.

After [BSIP 31](bsip-0031.md) is
in place, shorters will have more chance to not cover all debt on margin call,
but it's not 100% guaranteed, and they can only accept the result passively.

# Rationale

Different shorters have different expectations when being margin called:
* some want to close their short positions completely to cut losses;
* some want to sell as little collateral as possible to keep remaining short
  positions as large as possible;
* some want to sell more than minimum required collateral to reduce the
  possibility of being margin called again in the near future, but don't
  want to close their short positions completely.

With a new "target collateral ratio" option, all these expectations can be met.

## The Definition of Target Collateral Ratio

"Target collateral ratio" is an optional value which can be set onto a short
position, when the position being automatically liquidized (margin called),
sell no more than required collateral until collateral ratio of the position
reaches this value.
* Default value: not set, which means to sell as much collateral as possible,
  which is same to current behavior.
* When the value is set but below MCR, use MCR.
* When matching a margin call order with a force settle order, ignore this
  option.

## The Math

Let prices described below be in terms of `debt / collateral`,
e.g. how much CNY per BTS.

A margin call order can be matched with a limit order as either maker or taker,
in any case, there would be a matching price. We can solve an equation as
follows:

```
target_CR = new_collateral / ( new_debt / feed_price )
          = ( collateral - max_amount_to_sell ) * feed_price
            / ( debt - amount_to_get )
          = ( collateral - max_amount_to_sell ) * feed_price
            / ( debt - max_amount_to_sell * match_price )
=>
max_amount_to_sell = (debt * target_CR - collateral * feed_price)
                     / (target_CR * match_price - feed_price)
```

The result is a rational number, need to be rounded up to an integer.


# Specifications

## `call_order_object`

The `call_order_object` stores current status of a short position.

Need to add a new field into it:

* `optional<uint16_t> target_collateral_ratio;`

Same to other collateral ratios, the actual ratio is the value divided by
`GRAPHENE_COLLATERAL_RATIO_DENOM` aka `1000`.

Due to the `uint16_t` data type, the new field's maximum value is `65535`,
which means `6553.5%`.

## `call_order_update_operation`

The `call_order_update_operation` is used to open, update and close short
positions. It contains an `extensions` field:

* `extensions_type     extensions;`

Need to override data type of this field so it can include the new "target
collateral ratio" option.

## `call_order_update_evaluator`

The `call_order_update_evaluator` is used to evaluate and apply the
`call_order_udpate_operation`. Need to add logic:
* only allow `target_collateral_ratio` to be set after the hard fork;
* set/update/clear `target_collateral_ratio` field of `call_order_object`
  accordingly. Specifically,
  * set or update the field if it presents in the operation and is valid,
  * clear the field if it doesn't present in the operation or is not valid.

## `proposal_create_evaluator`

The `proposal_create_evaluator` is used to evaluate and apply the
`proposal_create_operation`, which can contain zero or more
`call_order_udpate_operation` objects. Need to add logic:
* only allow `target_collateral_ratio` to be set after the hard fork.

## Call Order Matching and Filling

After a call order get matched with a limit order and about to fill,
* if `target_collateral_ratio` is not set, process as before;
* if `target_collateral_ratio` is set, calculate maximum amount of collateral
  for sale according to the equation described above, then process as before.

### Rounding

Rules about rounding are defined in [BSIP 35](bsip-0035.md).

The rule for matching a limit order with a call order need to be revised as
(new rules **in bold**):
* if the call order is receiving the whole debt amount, which means it's
smaller and the short position will be closed after the match, round up its
paying amount;
* **otherwise,**
  * **if `target_collateral_ratio` is set and it's receiving the maximum debt
 amount according to `target_collateral_ratio`, see this order is smaller, try
 to round up its paying amount;**
    * **for edge cases, if its collateral ratio would not increase after being
   partially filled due to the round-up (which may even cause a black swan
   event in an extreme scenario), see `target_collateral_ratio` as not set for
   this time, re-apply the filling rules for this match.**
  * otherwise, round down its paying amount.
    * if the limit order would receive nothing, cancel it (it's smaller,
   so safe to cancel);
    * otherwise, calculate the amount that the limit order would pay as
   `round_up(receiving_amount * match_price)`. After filled both orders,
   if the limit order still exists, the remaining amount might be too small,
   so cancel it.


## UI/UX

The new option need to be presented and can be used in UI after the hard fork.

When there are call orders to be filled, if `target_collateral_ratio` option
is set, UI need to show exact amounts of collateral that another trader is able
to buy according to the equation described above.

# Discussion

With this BSIP, we provided a tool that can be used by shorters to keep their
positions, however, it's not always the best strategy to keep as large position
as possible, sometimes it's even more risky than just cutting losses.
Nevertheless, how to use the tool, is up to the traders to decide.
